# MultiInput

MultiInput is a program that allows remote keyboard + mouse input.

(Planned) Features:
* low latency remote control
* platform independent client
* multiple client support
* real-time 'voting mode' where all connected users vote on inputs in real-time

The main purpose of MultiInput is to enable a "Twitch Plays Pokemon" type setup. However, it is tuned more towards real-time games such as first-person shooters. With this in mind, currently the best way to use MultiInput is using a projector in a large room with each person having their own laptop to run the client. Low-latency streaming solutions are currently being investigated.
